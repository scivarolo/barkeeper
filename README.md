# Barkeeper
Do you like to make cocktails at home, but struggle with knowing what to make because you never have all of the ingredients for that cocktail you've been craving? Barkeeper aims to solve this problem by keeping track of your favorite cocktail recipes and your bar inventory. The app will let you know which of your favorite cocktails you can make with what you have on hand. Missing a crucial ingredient? Add it to your shopping list, and you won't forget it next time you go shopping.

## Bar Inventory
Manage your bar inventory: Add products, and update quantities and amount left.

## Cocktails
Save your favorite recipes, see which cocktails can be made with your current inventory, add missing ingredients to your shopping list, and make cocktails. When you make a cocktail, the ingredients used are deducted from your inventory.

## Shopping List
Once an item is purchased, you can add the product to your inventory.
